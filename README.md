# Data_Wrangling_Project_ALX-T_Udacity
## Data Gathering and Wrangling Training project
***********************************

### Introduction 

>**Project Oveview**: In this project, we believe that real-world data rarely come clean, So we will train ourselves by gathering data from various sources and in multiple formats, assessing its quality and tidiness, then cleaning it. We will document our wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries.)
 
> **A list of used technologies:**
* **Anaconda** the World's Most Popular Data Science Platform
* **Jupyter Notebook** the Data science integrated development environment (IDE)
* **NumPy** library for scientific computing in Python 
* **pandas** library for data cleaning and analysis in Python
* **Matplotlib** library for comprehensive visualizations in Python
*******************************
### Database chosen

The dataset that we will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

### The work done in this project was in the following order/Steps:
- Step 1: Gathering data
- Step 2: Assessing data 
- Step 3: Cleaning data 
- Step 4: Storing data 
- Step 5: Analyzing, and visualizing data (secondary)
- Step 6: Reporting


### Question(s) for Analysis

#### Q01 :
> **WHow much the users rating distripution vary?**
#### Q02 :  
> **what charactaristics popo, floofer, etc, are more present in dogs?**
